# Data-Analysis-on-retail-data

Analysis on different product and time hirarchies on online retail data

In this data analysis project, Iâ€™m using the Online Retail dataset, donated to UCI in 2015 by the School of Engineering at London South Bank University.
The dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail#

This is a transnational dataset containing transactions occurring between 01/Dec/2010 and 09/Dec/2011 for a UK-based and registered online retail company.
